# craftquests
Discord side for the crafting requests bot at [lionforgeguild.com/craftquests/](lionforgeguild.com/craftquests/). 

Make sure to edit settings_template.py and rename to settings.py. Can also use .env if you wish, but will need some (easy) modifications to code in bot.py.

MIT License. Good luck, have fun.

Worked fine with the following Python 3.9.2 dependencies:
discord.py 1.7.3, 
requests 2.25.1,
pandas 1.3.0,
dotenv,
